# CSCIC220FinalProject


# Save the World
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
The theme of this project is embodied in the player taking on the role of Cloud, the protagonist, who travels back in time to save a world devastated by aliens. To reverse the devastation, Cloud must strategically overcome challenges and defeat the boss to restore the past and secure the future. The gameplay emphasizes reversing traditional approaches by requiring players to adapt, rethink, and undo the destruction caused by the enemy. The title, "Save the World," reflects this reversal, as the focus is on turning back the clock, defeating the final boss, and restoring peace to the world.

## Game Play
Objective
Your mission is to navigate through levels, avoid falling off the map, and overcome various obstacles to find the Exit Sign. Along the way, pick up the gun to gain the ability to shoot. The ultimate goal is to defeat the Boss Enemy and save the world.

### Game-play instructions
- Move Left: Press `A`
- Move Right: Press `D`
- Jump: Press `Spacebar`
- Shoot (if you have the gun): Press `F`

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game

During development, I faced several challenges:
1. Implementing the "Reverse" theme meaningfully in the game mechanics and narrative.
2. Debugging issues with HP UI updates and ensuring it reflected correctly across scenes.
3. Managing audio transitions between scenes without interruptions.
4. Resolving bugs related to the restart button, which initially caused incorrect HP resets.
5. Balancing enemy mechanics, such as the Boss Enemy's fireball attacks and movement, to provide a fair but challenging experience.


## Implementation
Features
1. Dynamic HP UI: Updates in real-time as the player's health changes.
2. Seamless Background Music: Background music plays continuously across scenes, with a unique track for the end scene.
3. Boss Fight: Includes a challenging boss that fires projectiles and moves dynamically.
4. Enemy Mechanics: Enemies like the Enemy Bee actively pursue the player, creating dynamic obstacles.
5. Falling Detection: Players fail the level if they fall below a certain threshold.
6. Gun Mechanic: Players can pick up a gun to shoot enemies, adding depth to gameplay.
